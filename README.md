Dancesport-Web (in progress)

Dancesport-Web is a modernized tool designed for competitive ballroom dance events to handle thousands of entries and admission tickets entirely online. Prior to its inception, ballroom dance competitions are done primarily on paper -- fax, email, in-person, etc. Dancesport-Web's mission is to remove paper entirely from the process and save thousands of work hours and paper by having the page handle all the registration forms and ticket purchases.
