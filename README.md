Dancesport-Web (in progress) is a modernized tool designed for competitive ballroom dance events to handle thousands of entries and admission tickets entirely online. Prior to its inception, ballroom dance competitions are done primarily on paper -- fax, email, in-person, etc. Dancesport-Web's mission is to remove paper entirely from the process and save thousands of work hours and paper by having the page handle all the registration forms and ticket purchases.

When utilized, the competition staff will never have to submit 10,000+ entries by hand ever again nor have to mail out admission tickets.
